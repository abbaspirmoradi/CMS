The motivation for writing this paper is to discuss user knowledge gain through informational search sessions. 
The article evaluated the knowledge gain of users by employing scientifically formulated knowledge tests to calibrate a user’s knowledge before a search session using using pre-tested and evaluated knowledge tests, and assess it after the session. This work recruited participants were informed that the task entailed ‘searching the Web for some information' and randomly selected corpus of topics representing varying scopes of information needs (with some relatively broader than others). 


Moreover, this work employed SearchWell platform  on top of the Bing Web Search API that logged user activities in order to finding correlation between learning progress and individual user activity features. 

At first, the paper by using the accuracy of users in a knowledge test investigate the relationship between the average knowledge gain of users through informational search sessions and their average topic familiarity. The results prove that corresponding to a topic  a significant effect of information need on user queries and navigational patterns, but does not directly effect the knowledge gain of users. However, there is strongly negative linear relationship between the knowledge gain of users in informational search sessions and the topic familiarity.
This suggests that the more popular a topic is, or the more familiar that users are with a topic, the lesser they tend to learn about the topic in informational search sessions.



Additionally, the observations shows the number of unique terms in the last query is greater than the number of unique terms entered by users in their first query.
There’s a fairly obvious reason why this is the case; the users consume more information through the course of a search session related to a given topic, their queries
tend to become longer. Furthermore, evaluating the user clicks shows that there is  no significant correlation between the click interval and knowledge gain of users.

We found a significant difference in the number of unique terms used by users across different topic conditions  Users who spent more active time on webpages depicted a higher knowledge gain.


We also found a positive correlation between the average complexity of queries entered by users and their knowledge gain.
Our findings revealed deeper insights into the search behavior of users in informational search sessions, and the impact of information needs on knowledge gain.


We did not find a significant linear relationship between the number of unique query terms entered by users and their knowledge gain in search sessions.


 This suggests that as the users consume more information through the course of a search session related to a given topic, their queries tend to become longer.


The paper tries to find a relation between session lengths of users and their knowledge gain in informational search sessions corresponding to the different topics and suggests that length of a session does not directly influence the knowledge gain of users.

We did not find a significant linear relationship between the number of web pages that users navigated to, and their knowledge gain. We found no significant effect of such navigation behavior on the knowledge gain. We also found no significant linear relationship between these two variables.

This suggests that the amount of time that users spend actively on web pages within the search session describes around 7% of the variance
in their knowledge gain.


We analyzed the pay-level domains (PLDs) of search engine results pages (SERPs) consumed by users during the informational search sessions. However, we did not
find a significant linear relationship between the knowledge gain of users and the number of PLDs accessed by them during the informational search sessions.

Next, we investigated the amount of time that users spent on the SERPs. We differentiate between the time users actively spent exploring the snippets on the search results page, and the total amount of time spent including the idle time. We found no significant effect of the topics on the total amount of time that users spent on the
search results page on average.


 We did not find a significant linear relationship between the knowledge gain of users and the active time spent on the results page.

We also analyzed the number of web pages that users navigated to directly from the SERP and those that users navigated to from other web pages.

we found no significant linear relationship between the knowledge gain of users and the number of pages navigated from either search
result pages or non-SERPs.


we also found a positive linear relationship between the knowledge gain of users and the percentage of query terms fired by them that did not overlap with terms in either the topic description or the knowledge tests.This suggests that the nature of the query terms that users enter in
the search sessions (in terms of overlap with topic descriptions or knowledge tests) can explain around 17% of the variance in their
knowledge gain.


We also analyzed the complexity of the queries fired by users in search sessions corresponding to the different topics.e found a positive linear relationship between the knowledge gain of users and their corresponding average query complexit. This suggests that the complexity of
queries entered by users during the informational search sessions in our setup, explains 25% of the variance in their knowledge gain.
